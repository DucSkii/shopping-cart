The goal of this project was to make a simple eCommerce website and have it be deployed.

Functionality that I wished to include:
- Have a home page, a page for each of the items, a favourites page and a checkout page
- Have a fully functional navagation system using react-router-dom
- Be able to add items to cart and have the option to pre-select the delivery
- Be able to add certain items into your favourites list
- Use localstoraging to keep the items in your favourites list and cart
- Have a total price in the checkouts page that updates live
- Use fakerJs to randomise item cost, image and name
- Have a filter system on the item pages, including a sliding filter for the prices

This project was fully deployed using firebase
