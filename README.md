The goal of this project was to make a simple eCommerce website and have it be deployed.

Functionality that I wished to include:
- Have a home page, a page for each of the items, a favourites page and a checkout page
- Have a fully functional navagation system using react-router-dom.
- Be able to add items to cart and have the option to pre-select the delivery.
- Be able to add certain items into your favourites list.
- Use localstoraging to keep the items in your favourites list and cart.
- Have a total price in the checkouts page that updates live.
- Use fakerJs to randomise item cost, image and name.
- Have a filter system on the item pages, including a sliding filter for the prices.

Improvments that can be made:
- This is my first big project and I did not think about the reposiveness of the website making it incompatible for mobile devices. I have learnt from this and for the next project I made sure to include responsiveness from the mobile-first approach.
- The search bar is very half-functional, it does not give "suggested searches" or "auto-fill searches" and only works on the page of items you are currently on. This can be improved by figuring out how to search from any page.
- Have a way to track the users location to change the delivery address on the header, this could be done by having user authentication and a customisable profile per user.



The designing was done completely with css/scss and the icons were provided by "Font Awesome"

This project was fully deployed using firebase
